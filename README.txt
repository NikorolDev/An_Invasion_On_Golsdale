Before you play The Invasion On Golsdale.

Set Game.html as start page

The game will most likely not work on Internet Explorer.
The most preferred browsers to use to play the game are: Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.

If you want to start menu music when window loads, then you must interact with the browser.
I suggest clicking the window a bunch of times before the menu is loaded.

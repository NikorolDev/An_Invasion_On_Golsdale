Before you play The Invasion On Golsdale if you decide to download the game from here.
Preferable follow this link to the build of the game:

The game will most likely not work on Internet Explorer and has not been tested on Microsoft Edge.
The most preferred browsers to play the game are: Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.

If you want to start menu music when window loads, then you must interact with the browser.
I suggest clicking the window a bunch of times before the menu is loaded.
